## Challenge - Solving Merge Conflict

This challenge is designed to evaluate your understanding of the basic concepts covered in Class 1 - Git.

A file has been created with your corresponding name, and a branch has been created using the first two letters of your name followed by the numbers "2023." For example, "DA-2023." Given the following scenario, please resolve the merge conflict that will occurr once you try to merge your branch into the main branch.

**Scenario:**
A merge conflict will arise due to conflicting changes to the file containing your name while trying to merge with the main branch. Your task is to resolve this conflict and ensure a successful merger. Follow the steps below to complete the challenge:

1. Checkout the branch with your name, such as "DA-2023."
2. Make the necessary modifications to resolve the merge conflict.
3. Commit the changes after resolving the conflict.
4. Push the branch to the remote repository.
5. Create a pull request with your branch and provide any additional details or explanations related to your solution.

Branch list:
EN-2023 -> Enzo
FL-2023 -> Flor
IS-2023 -> Isabella
MA-2023 -> Mateo
MT-2023 -> Matias

Note: The main branch to use for this exercise is **MERGE-2023**

Please note that the main objective of this challenge is to demonstrate your ability to resolve merge conflicts using Git. Good luck!
