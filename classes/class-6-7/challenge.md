## Challenge - JS exercises

This challenge is designed to test your understanding of various JS concepts.

**Instructions:**

1. Checkout the `development` branch and from there create a new branch with the following structure: `C6-<YOURNAME>2023` (e.g., `C6-DANIEL2023`)
2. Create a new folder with your name.
3. Create JS file for each exercise with the solution.
4. Commit the changes.
5. Push your changes
6.  Create a pull request with your branch and provide any additional details or explanations related to your solutions.

**Bonus:**

Create individual commits using conventional commit messages that are focused on each major change made.

Remember that when we are working on a project, it is important to make meaningful and granular commits. By using conventional commit messages, you can provide clear and specific information about each major change introduced. This approach helps in better understanding the commit history, enables easier code review, and facilitates effective collaboration among team members.
