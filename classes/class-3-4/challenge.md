## Challenge - Flexbox and Grid Layout

This challenge is designed to test your understanding of various CSS concepts, including absolute and relative units, selectors, flexbox, and grid layout. Your task is to create a responsive webpage layout using the provided HTML structure and apply CSS properties to achieve the desired design.

**Instructions:**

1. Checkout the `development` branch and from there create a new branch with the following structure: `C3-<YOURNAME>2023` (e.g., `C3-DANIEL2023`)
2. Using the already existing `index.html` file, create a CSS file named `styles.css` and link it to the HTML file.
3. Apply a responsive layout using flexbox or grid to achieve the following structure:

- The header should span the entire width of the page and have a height of 80 pixels.
- The navigation should be displayed as a horizontal menu and have a height of 50 pixels.
- The main section should be divided into three equal-width columns with a 20-pixel gap between them.
- Each section within the main should have a minimum height of 300 pixels and a maximum height of 500 pixels.
- The footer should span the entire width of the page and have a height of 60 pixels.

4. Use appropriate CSS selectors to target specific elements for styling. Apply different background colors, font properties, and alignment as desired.
5. Experiment with absolute and relative units (e.g., pixels, percentages) to achieve the desired dimensions and spacing.
6. Implement media queries to make the layout responsive and adjust the styling for different screen sizes. Ensure that the layout remains visually appealing and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
7. Save your CSS file and open the HTML file in a web browser to test your layout. Make any necessary adjustments to achieve the desired design.

8. Commit the changes.
9. Push the branch to the remote repository.
10. Create a pull request with your branch and provide any additional details or explanations related to your solution.

**Bonus:**

Create individual commits using conventional commit messages that are focused on each major change made.

Remember that when we are working on a project, it is important to make meaningful and granular commits. By using conventional commit messages, you can provide clear and specific information about each major change introduced. This approach helps in better understanding the commit history, enables easier code review, and facilitates effective collaboration among team members.
