## Challenge - Building a Blog Page using HTML

This challenge is designed to evaluate your understanding of the basic concepts covered in Class 2 - HTML.

Create an HTML file that demonstrates the use of semantic structure, a navigation bar, and a blog post section.

**Instructions:**
1. Checkout the `development` branch and from there create a new branch with the following structure: `C2-<YOURNAME>2023` (e.g., `C2-DANIEL2023`)
   
2. Create an HTML file named `<yourname>.html` (e.g., `daniel.html`) and open it in your preferred text editor.
   
3. Begin by setting up the basic structure of the HTML document using appropriate HTML5 semantic elements.
   
4. Inside the <body> tag, create a header section using the <header> element. Within the header, include the website title and a navigation bar.
   
5. Implement the navigation bar using the <nav> element. Include at least three navigation links, such as "Home," "Blog," and "About."
   
6. Below the header, create a main content section using the <main> element.
   
7. Inside the main content section, create a blog post section using the appropriate semantic element(s) to structure the content.
   
8. Within the blog post section, include a heading for the blog post title using an appropriate heading element (e.g., <h1>).
   
9.  Write a sample blog post content using paragraphs, headings, lists, or any other HTML elements you find suitable for a blog post.

10. Commit the changes.
    
11. Push the branch to the remote repository.
    
12. Create a pull request with your branch and provide any additional details or explanations related to your solution.

**Bonus:**

Create individual commits using conventional commit messages that are focused on each major change made.

Remember that when we are working on a project, it is important to make meaningful and granular commits. By using conventional commit messages, you can provide clear and specific information about each major change introduced. This approach helps in better understanding the commit history, enables easier code review, and facilitates effective collaboration among team members.
