            Metal music is a genre of rock music that developed in the late
            1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United
            States. It is characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic
            rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound and vigorous vocals. Metal music
            has roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock and acid rock, but also
            incorporates elements of classical music, punk rock, hip-hop and
            other genres. Some of the most famous pioneers of metal music are
            Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, while some of the most
            popular and influential bands are Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas
            Priest and Slayer. Metal music has many subgenres that vary in
            style, speed, aggression and themes, such as heavy metal, thrash
            metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, symphonic metal and nu metal. Metal music is often associated with a subculture of fans
            called "metalheads" or "headbangers", who enjoy the loudness, energy
            and complexity of the music.
